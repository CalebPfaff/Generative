# Generative

A collection of my p5.js sketches

# Site features
- Sketches always expand to fit the screen, respecting aspect ratio set for sketch
- Sketches render the same no matter the resolution of the screen you're viewing it on
- You can add ?seed=YOUR_NUMBER to view or share certain sketches just based off url
    - Example:  https://calebpfaff.github.io/Generative/sketches/strange_attractors/index.html?seed=67403220
- Meta tags for the website to have the image/description when you share the url
- Main page itself is a p5 sketch
- Nice little link to github repo
